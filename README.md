# Mobile-Price-Prediction-Classification
In this project, I analyzed dataset 'train.csv' to predict mobile ‘Price Range’ for dataset 'test.csv'. I performed preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualized insights. Utilized Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM models to predict 'Price Range', allowing analysis of mobile device pricing based on comprehensive features.
